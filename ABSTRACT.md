The authors of the **Severstal: Steel Defect Detection** dataset acknowledge that steel holds a paramount position as one of the most vital building materials in modern construction. Its resilience against both natural elements and wear caused by human activities has rendered it indispensable worldwide. In the pursuit of enhancing the efficiency of steel production, the Severstal competition aims to play a pivotal role in the detection of defects within the steel production process.

The intricate process of producing flat sheet steel demands precision and care at every step, from heating and rolling to drying and cutting. Numerous machines come into contact with flat steel before it's deemed ready for use. At present, Severstal employs images from high-frequency cameras to drive a defect detection algorithm.

In this competition, participants are tasked with aiding engineers in refining this algorithm by localizing and categorizing surface defects on steel sheets.
This competition aims to predict the location and type of defects found in steel manufacturing by segmenting and classifying the defects in the test set.

Each image may have no defects, a defect of a single class, or defects of multiple classes. There are 3 different defect classes.
